> **This plugin is unmaintained:** While I've been hoping that I'd be able to update this for Obsidian 1.0, I've chosen to focus on my other plugin, [Projects](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-projects). I don't know when (or if) I'll be able to get back to this plugin.

## Troubleshooting

Obsidian Vale doesn't yet support the new editor that was introduced in Obsidian 13.

To continue using the plugin for version 13, you can enable the Legacy Editor.

1. Open **Settings** -> **Editor**.
2. Enable **Legacy Editor**.
3. Restart Obsidian.
